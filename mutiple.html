				omething other than its inherent dimensions. If a height or width is specified on the image using CSS, or the image src is invalid (thus having no inherent height and width), this issue can occur. If an image that is inherently, say, 50x50 pixels is placed in a fixed element and left at its inherent dimensions, this issue does not seem to occur.
When a position: fixed element appears anywhere on a page, most 2D CSS transforms will fail. Oddly, only translate transforms seem unaffected by this. Even more oddly, this issue is solved by setting a CSS opacity of .9 or below on the parent of the fixed element.
Combinations of position: fixed and overflow properties are best avoided, as both have been known to cause unpredictable issues in older versions of Android OS.
Any element that triggers the on-screen keyboard, when placed inside a position: fixed element, will fail to respond to user input when using anything other than the default keyboard. This includes Swype, XT9 or, it seems, any input method apart from the standard non-predictive keyboard.
While we will continue to try to find ways to mitigate these bugs as best we can, we currently advise against implementing fixed toolbars containing complicated user styles and form elements without extomething other than its inherent dimensions.
